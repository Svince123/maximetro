Maxi Metro is a Traffic game inspired by Mini Metro. 
It is writen in Python using Pygame. Should be multi user some day.

Stil in early pre-alpha. I plan to make a more strategical game than
Mini Metro is.

Gameplay
--------

Just click around to get a feeling for the game. You should build lines. Than railcars run on them and transport passengers to ther destinations. You gain points for delivered passengers. The buttons at the right delete or add tracks to existing lines.

But keep in mind: The game is stil in very early development and far from beeing an interesting game.

Installation:
-------------

You need python and pygame. Under Debian/Ubuntu ans similar systems the following should work:

	apt-get install python python-pygame git
	git clone https://github.com/bennibaermann/maximetro.git
	maximetro/maximetro
	
I have no idea how to install under other systems. But in general you need python and pygame and than clone the git repository.

Have fun.
