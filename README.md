Maxi Metro is a Traffic game inspired by Mini Metro. 
It is writen in Python using Pygame. Should be multi user some day.

Stil in early pre-alpha. I plan to make a more strategical game than
Mini Metro is.

Installation:
-------------

You need python and pygame. Under Debian/Ubuntu ans similar systems the following should work:

	apt-get install python python-pygame git
	git clone https://github.com/bennibaermann/maximetro.git
	maximetro/maximetro
	
I have no idea how to install under other systems. But in general you need python and pygame and than clone the git repository.

have fun.
