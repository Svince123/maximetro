BUGS:
=====

- passengers in deleted cars should leave at the exact position, not all
at the same position.

- drawing of passengers in cars is stil not correct.

- in some situation pathfinding does not work and passengers don't
enter any car

- sometimes lines can have colors already taken, and infinite lines can
be build.

- sometimes deletion or adding tracks does not work.

- not sure if allready activ: sometimes
changing of colours for tracks to be deleted does not work (or wrong
color). 

- sometimes tracks change color during creation and the game creates
dicontinued lines.

- cost of building tracks should be handled at first click at station, not if actual
builded

- error status "NO MORE LINES AVAIABLE" is shown to often and not if
really needed

FEATURES until first alpha:
===========================

- clean up code in main()

- no known severe bugs

- decide next stationtype before clicking and show it in interface

- better use of statusline

- error messages in red

- deletion of tracks with cars should generally be possible
(passangers in deleted cars should be handled)

- deletion of last or first track should be possible (interface
needed: maybe right click should change which will be deleted?)

- append new track at start or begin (interface needed: second click
changes side)

- fiddling with constants to reach a good game experience

- nice looking font


Ideas for later versions
========================

- maybe: 3 types of ressources (square, triangle, circle) instead of just one
score. different things to build need different ressources.

- cars turn at stations slowly to new direction.
