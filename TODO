BUGS:

- in some situation pathfinding does not work and passengers don't
enter any car

- sometimes lines can have colors already taken

FEATURES until first alpha:

- no known bugs

- passangers in deleted cars should be handled

- deletion of last or first track should be possible (interface needed)

- append new track at start or begin (interface needed)

- building stations, tracks, cars, lines should cost ressources (score)

- 3 types of ressources (square, triangle, circle) instead of just one
score. different things to build need different ressources.

- fiddling with constants to reach a good game experience

- a release structure

- in game error messages
