BUGS:
=====

- add_track-marker should not be drawn if max tracks at station reached.

- cost of building tracks should be handled at first click at station, not if actual
builded

FEATURES until first alpha:
===========================

- clean up code in main()

- classes Track and Line should be in own file

- no known severe bugs

- decide next stationtype before clicking and show it in interface

- better use of statusline

- error messages in red

- deletion of tracks with cars should generally be possible

- deletion of last or first track should be possible (interface
needed: maybe right click should change which will be deleted?)

- show append-station with colored station if mouse over add-button.

- append new track at start or begin (interface needed: second click
changes side) 

- fiddling with constants to reach a good game experience

- nice looking font


Not severe Bugs
===============

- CROSSING=True does not work

- pathfinding could be better some times.

- if a circle in a line is constructed with deletion, there is no circle.


Roadmap
=======

Beta: Feature complete single-player

1.0: Bugfree and feature complete single-player

2.0: multi-player


Ideas for later versions
========================

- maybe: 3 types of ressources (square, triangle, circle) instead of just one
score. different things to build need different ressources.

- cars turn at stations slowly to new direction.
