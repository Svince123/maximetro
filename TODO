BUGS:
=====

- in some situation pathfinding does not work and passengers don't
enter any car

- sometimes lines can have colors already taken, and infinit lines can
be build.

- sometimes deletion or adding tracks does not work. sometimes
changing of colours for tracks to be deleted does not work (or wrong
color). this occurs only after first deletion (?)

FEATURES until first alpha:
===========================

- no known severe bugs

- better use of statusline

- error messages in red

- deletion of tracks with cars should generally be possible
(passangers in deleted cars should be handled)

- deletion of last or first track should be possible (interface
needed: maybe right click should change which will be deleted?)

- append new track at start or begin (interface needed: maybe right
click?)

- building stations, tracks, cars, lines should cost ressources (score)

- maybe: 3 types of ressources (square, triangle, circle) instead of just one
score. different things to build need different ressources.

- fiddling with constants to reach a good game experience
