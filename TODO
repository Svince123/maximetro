BUGS:
=====

- still sometimes wrong line colors (not reproducable)

- still sometimes undeletable lines and lines can not be made longer
(not reproduceable)

- cost of building tracks should be handled at first click at station, not if actual
builded

- pathfinding should be better some times. for example: if it is shorter at the way back, passengers
should not enter car.


FEATURES until first alpha:
===========================

- pathfinding: if to many passengers of one kind waiting at one
station, choose second best option for them too.

- variable screen size. proportional sizes of stations et al

- no known severe bugs

- some more shapes

- decide next stationtype before clicking and show it in interface

- better use of statusline (or status as popup in the middle?)

- error messages in red

- deletion of tracks with cars should generally be possible, cars
should move to next track

- interface: mouse wheel should change position of adding and deleting
tracks. deleting in the middle should generate two lines, adding in
the middle should generate two tracks and delete one. two stations
should be displayed colour

- fiddling with constants to reach a good game experience


Features in beta-stage
======================

- level system


Not severe Bugs
===============

- CROSSING=True does not work

- if a circle in a line is constructed with deletion, there is no circle.


Roadmap
=======

Beta: Feature complete single-player

1.0: Bugfree and feature complete single-player

2.0: multi-player


Ideas for later versions
========================

- maybe: 3 types of ressources (square, triangle, circle) instead of just one
score. different things to build need different ressources.

- cars turn at stations slowly to new direction.
