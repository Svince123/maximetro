BUGS:

- in some situation pathfinding does not work and passengers don't
enter any car

- add track to existing line can overwrite MAXSTATIONTRACKS. sure?

- starting new line at station can overwrite MAXSTATIONTRACKS. sure?

- line object is not deleted correctly, maybe this causes:

  - deleting track during track drawing leave garbage graphics behind
  (sometimes)

  - deleting lines lets crash line.is_circle() called by pathfinding 
  sometimes 

FEATURES:

- building stations, tracks, cars, lines should cost ressources (score)

- 3 types of ressources (square, triangle, circle) instead of just one
score. different things to build need different ressources.

- fiddling with constants to reach a good game experience

- a release structure
